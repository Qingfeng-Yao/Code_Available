外网热议AFK排名：闷头发育的狗头怎么能叫挂机呢？
本帖转载自自虎扑电竞，原贴链接为：https://bbs.hupu.com/31389415.html挂机英雄前五排行榜：布隆，亚索，剑圣，狗头和劫 No real suprise here for the dawg, even when actually playing, he's just afk farming stacks.看见我们的狗头在这里一点都不以外，因为他们就算在认真玩，他们也是在那里挂机然后攒层数I feel like that's a huge issue with Nasus in general. I think he's actually stronger than his winrate indicates, but people don't actually know when to stop stacking. I can't tell you the number of games I've lost with or won against a Nasus that just infinitely stacked minions and didn't push a win when he was able to. People don't realize he's the strongest mid-game. 1000 stacks isn't gunna matter if you just end up CC'd and AA'd to death by Vayne.我觉得这就是狗头这个英雄的问题。我觉得他比实际胜率表现出来的东西要强，但是人们并不知道什么时候该停止发育攒层数了。我经历过很多把因为狗头一直不停的埋头发育而不选择参团导致输掉局。人们并不知道其实狗头在中期是非常强的。如果你一直被控到死然后被薇恩A死的话，1000层又有什么意义呢？Still only fourth cos no one plays him有一说一，狗头排名第四只是因为没人玩他as a nasus main for about 4 year i NEVER afki don't get why many of the players who play him go afk? i assume they first time him and then get shit on in lane and then just quit the game.作为主玩狗头四年的玩家，我从来不挂机我不明白为什么那么多玩狗头的人选择挂机呢？我猜他们一次玩的时候直接在线上被打炸了，然后直接退游戏了。I'm more suprised that riven is no longer first, and that she's even out of the top 20.They certainly used to be the top one, iirc.我更惊讶的时候瑞文竟然不是第1了，前20也见不到她了。如果我记得没错的话，她以前是第1嗷Riven stopped being an early game bully that had to snowball and was constantly exposed to ganks she had to outplay.And now is flexible so she is less frustating.瑞文以前是一个前期很厉害但是需要滚雪球的英雄，一直被gank之后她需要靠精湛的操作才能活下去。现在经过修改之后，她的情况变好了一些。Because she used to be an early game monster that was borderline useless late game. Now she has a mediocre early and a strong mid/late.因为她以前在前期的时候是个怪物，然后到了后期就是个废物。现在前期更加中庸一些，但是中后期变强了。that changed when yasuo was released自从亚索出世以来，她就被拉下了冠军宝座According to that site, Braum hasn't had a 50% winrate in almost 2 years now.根据那个网站，布隆在将近两年里胜率一直低于50% (网站地址https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/rankings/afk-stats）He hasn't. Braum got overnerfed due to competitive dominance. Similar thing happened to Kench this last season.确实是这样的。因为在职业赛场上的表现，布隆被过度削弱了。就像上个赛季的塔姆一样。I bet the AFK is from the small pool of people left who pick braum then 3 minutes in realize they cant do anything but get poked down and go afk.我猜造成高挂机率的原因是一小部分人选了布隆，然后在3分钟的意识到他们并不能在线上干任何事情，然后被poke到死，选择了挂机Considering the very large gap between #1 and #2, I'd assume there's a smaller sample size for Braum making his afk rate seem higher than it actually is.考虑到第一和第二之间有着很大的数据上的差别，我猜测因为布隆有着更小的选取率使得他的挂机率比实际的挂机人数显得要高。Braum is one of the least played champions in pubs so probably.布隆有着最低的选取率之一，所以你说的应该是真的。I’m not surprised about Braum. All the ones I have played with have been really bossy and think they’re always right. They also tend to be one of the worst in execution看到布隆我一点都不惊讶。我碰见的布隆都觉得自己特别厉害，自己干的都是正确的。他们也往往是队伍里最菜的。Nasus isnt AFK, he is just farming top.有一说一，狗头那不叫挂机，他只是在上路发育。Maybe if you don’t let him farm in game, he farms irl.如果你不让他在峡谷里发育，他下了游戏就去种田了。Thats what im wondering. Are these stats based on reports? If so it makes a lost of sens! Lol这也是我想问的。这些数据的来源是举报吗？如果是这样的话，那么就说得通了。本文由虎扑电竞作者虎扑电竞授权转载如无授权请勿二次使用
